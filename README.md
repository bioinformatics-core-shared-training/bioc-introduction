## Introduction to Bioconductor

### Overview

This is a short (2/3 hour) course introducing the Bioconductor project for analysing high-throughput biological datasets. It assumes that the course participant is familiar with the basic usage of R, such as covered in our R crash course.

The example dataset is a breast cancer study using microarray technology, however similar techniques can be applied to more-modern technoloies such as RNA-seq
